The NTC consists of using molecular-grade nuclease-free water in RT-PCR reactions instead of RNA. The NTC reactions for all primer and crRNA sets should not generate any signal. An assay is defined as positive, if it falls outside of three standard deviations of the mean of all NTCs. The NTC with the no-crRNA assay is only an outlier, if the signal is more than three standard deviations above the mean. If it is lower, no error occurs, since the background signal is generally lower for the no-crRNA assay. If any of the NTC reactions (RT-PCR) generates an outlying signal, sample contamination may have occurred. This will invalidate the assay of the positive viral marker.

The Combined RVP Positive Control consists of nine components (partial synthetic nucleic acids), combined as directed in the Reagent and Controls Preparation section to make the final control sample for the reaction. Combined RVP Positive Control consists of partial synthetic targets at 1e3 copy/ul. The Combined RVP Positive Control is prepared alongside each batch of clinical specimens and should be positive for all nine targets in the CARMEN RVP Assay.
If the CARMEN RVP PC generates a negative result for any target, this indicates a possible problem with primer mixes used in RT-PCR reactions or crRNA-cas13 detection and will invalidate the assay with the negative CPC. The assay is defined as negative, if it falls outside of three standard deviations of the mean of all CPCs. The CPC with the no-crRNA assay is expected to be negative, is excluded from the CPC mean, and will be invalid if the signal falls within three standard deviations of the mean of the CPCs.
